13:Ta35,<p>I've been asked a few times recently about how to learn <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Sign_Language"><strong>American Sign Language</strong></a> (ASL), so I wanted to share some advice for those interested in starting their journey.</p>
<p>The best way to learn ASL is to learn directly from Deaf people. This can include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Enrolling in an ASL class taught by a Deaf instructor</li>
<li>Attending Deaf events in your area</li>
<li>Building friendships with Deaf individuals</li>
<li>Volunteering with organizations that serve the Deaf community</li>
</ul>
<p>While nothing can replace the experience of learning from Deaf people, there are also many excellent online resources available for those who may not have access to in-person opportunities. Below, I've compiled a list of resources that I personally recommend.</p>
<h2>Online Resources</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><a href="https://www.lifeprint.com/">Lifeprint</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/pages-layout/instructor.htm">Dr. Bill Vicars</a> is a Deaf ASL professor at California State University, Sacramento. He has a ton of free resources on Lifeprint, including a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/billvicars">YouTube channel</a> with hundreds of videos.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<h3><a href="https://www.handspeak.com/">Handspeak</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.handspeak.com/learn/1/">Jolanta Lapiak</a> is a Deaf ASL instructor, and the founder of Handspeak. The dictionary on this website is one of the best I've found.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Fingerspelling</h3>
<p>I would strongly recommend learning fingerspelling early on. It's a very important part of ASL, and it's used quite often. It's also a great way to learn new vocabulary and can serve as a fallback when you don't know a sign. Just be careful not to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYAVL1Dxokk">overuse it</a>!</p>
<h2>Local Resources</h2>
<p>If you by chance live in the Seattle metropolitan area like I do, there are a few local resources I'd recommend.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to Deaf Events in Seattle</li>
<li><a href="https://www.visuallyspeaking.info/">Visually Speaking</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.bellevuecollege.edu/worldlanguages/departments/american-sign-language-asl/">Bellevue College ASL Classes</a></li>
<li><a href="https://hsdc.org/education/resources/">More resources at Hearing, Speech &#x26; Deaf Center (HSDC)</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I hope this helps! Whether you're learning ASL for the first time, or you're brushing up on your skills, I wish you the best of luck. 😊</p>
